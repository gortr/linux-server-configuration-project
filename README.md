## Summary of Configurations

This was a long and detailed learning experience for me as I completed this project. Let's not keep you waiting any longer, join me on how the adventure unfolded!

### 1 - Initial Login

1. I logged in as the default user for my instance of Ubuntu via Amazon Lightsail utilizing the following command,

`ssh ubuntu@13.58.216.33 -p 2200 -i ~/.ssh/LightsailDefaultPrivateKey-us-east-2.pem`

The above terminal command indicates that I would like to connect via ssh as said intended user of the servers ip address. The `-p` command indicates I want to connect to a specific port which includes the port number after it. The command including the `-i` and after it indicate that I would like to authenticate my access to the server via a private key. The private key is then matched to the servers existing public key to confirm I am who I say I am. Once authenticated I gain access to the server remotely.

2. Updated all currently installed packages

I immeadiately proceeded to updating all the server installed packages so they would be up to date for my usage in the application deployment process. I used the command `sudo apt-get upgrade` and proceeded to install the utility software called finger. To install finger I just had to run the command `apt-get install finger`. One could also run the previous command with the `sudo` prefix command as well just in case.

3. Create a new user with sudo permissions and with a key-based authentication? No problem!



# x - Final Checks and Restarts

x. After verifying that all was working appropriately and as per project specifications I then proceeded to restart the Apache service.
